# Programming-1
These programs were done during beginning of my studies, so beware bad practises. Some things have been done poorly just because of given conditions (such as "using arrays is forbidden"). None of this was checked by human. It was tested automatically by BaCa - a code testing system - so I haven't too much choice with implementation, I've just fulfilled given tasks.

All documentation such as content of the tasks or just code's comments - and even some of variables' names - are written in Polish.
